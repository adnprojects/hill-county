## 📖 About The Project

The Hill County landing page is built to visually immerse potential buyers in the community before they ever visit the site. By utilizing GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), the site features smooth, high-end scroll animations that guide users through the project's amenities—including the clubhouse, swimming pool, and parks—while providing easy access to downloadable masterplans and brochures.

## ✨ Key Features & Highlights

* **Advanced UI Animations:** Smooth scrolling, reveal effects, and interactive elements powered by custom `gsap-animations.js`.
* **Amenity Spotlights:** Dedicated visual sections for the clubhouse, pool, park, and grand entrance.
* **Downloadable Assets:** Direct links for users to download the official `brochure.pdf` and `layout.pdf`.
* **Clean Code Architecture:** Logic is cleanly separated into distinct styling (`styles.css`, `animations.css`) and scripting (`app.js`, `gsap-animations.js`) files.
* **Automated Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline integrated via GitHub Actions (`static.yml`) for seamless deployment to GitHub Pages.
